This is a fork of the following repo:

- https://github.com/eoinsha/JavaPhoenixChannels

Changes have been made to optimise the behaviour to match my own use cases.


## Internal Testing

For production usage, bintray is used to host the jar file generated from this library. But for internal testing, Jitpack.io is used.
